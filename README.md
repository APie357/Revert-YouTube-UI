# Revert-Youtube-UI
a temporary solution to revert to the old ui. the new ui was put into effect since april and is slowly rolling out to users.


# Paste the following code below into console
document.cookie = "PREF=f6=8";


your youtube ui should be back to normal!

feel free to update this code into and extension or modify it however you'd like!
