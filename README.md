a temporary solution to revert to the old ui. the new ui was put into effect since april and is slowly rolling out to users.


# Steps
Download the <a href="https://github.com/apersongithub/Revert-YouTube-UI/releases/">latest release</a>

goto chrome://extensions

(make sure developer mode is enabled)

Drag the zip file to the extensions page

You're good to go!

**If it still doesn't work I would recommend refreshing youtube on the homepage atleast once**

Im working on a css version/perm fix so this wont be an issue

your youtube ui should be back to normal!
