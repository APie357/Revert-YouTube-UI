# Revert-Youtube-UI
a temporary solution to revert to the old ui. the new ui was put into effect since april and is slowly rolling out to users.


# Steps
Download the latest version
goto chrome://extensions
(make sure developer mode is enabled)
Drag the zip file to the extensions page
You're good to go!


your youtube ui should be back to normal!
